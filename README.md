Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project

When you run this script in R\Rstudio you will automatically obtain the final tidy dataset tidyDT.txt.

The other file, CodeBook.md, is useful to get some detailed information about the way the analysis has been done,
the meaning and the structure of the variables. You can read it in R\RStudio and then view an HTML version of it, or you can simply open the file with a txt reader.
