Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project 

In this repo you can find an R script run_analysis.R to collect, work with, and clean a data set.
When you run this script you will obtain the final tidy dataset tidyDT.txt.

The other file, CodeBook.md, is useful to get some detailed information about the way the analysis has been done,
the meaning and the structure of the variables.
